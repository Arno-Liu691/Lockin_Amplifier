# Lockin\_Amplifier

A digital lockin amplifier with front end analogue amplification and digital decoding



\# LIA\_4 — Project README



\*\*LIA\_4\*\* is my STM project. This repository includes the embedded code/project, an LTspice simulation for the analog front-end, all measurement data, and supporting images/schematics.



\## Contents



\- \*\*LIA\_4/\*\*  

&nbsp; The STM project (source, config, and build files).



\- \*\*Final\_draft\_AD8429\*\*  

&nbsp; LTspice simulation file(s) for the analog front-end based on the AD8429 instrumentation amplifier.



\- \*\*lia\_data/\*\*  

&nbsp; All measurement data collected during development and testing.



\- \*\*Images \& Drawings\*\*  

&nbsp; Filenames are self-descriptive and match what they show. For example:  

&nbsp; - \*\*PCB picture\*\* — photo(s) of the final integrated PCB.  

&nbsp; - \*\*AFE schematics\*\* — analog front-end schematic diagram.



\## Getting Started



\### STM Project

1\. Open the `LIA\_4` project with your STM toolchain/IDE.

2\. Configure the target and toolchain as needed.

3\. Build and flash to your board.



\### LTspice Simulation

1\. Open `Final\_draft\_AD8429` in LTspice.  

2\. Run the simulation to inspect the analog front-end behavior (gain, bandwidth, noise, etc.).



\### Measurement Data

\- Browse `lia\_data/` for raw or processed logs.  

\- Import into your preferred analysis tool (e.g., Python, MATLAB, Excel).



\## Notes

\- Image filenames correspond directly to their content (e.g., “PCB picture”, “AFE schematics”) to make navigation straightforward.

\- If your OS/shell has trouble with filenames containing spaces, wrap them in quotes.
